README - MPD26 Midi Control
Akai MPD26 Midi Controller Map
Feb 08/2020 - Gord Harris - added UI

This patch lets you use,
 6 fader sliders, 6 knobs and
 5 transport control buttons
 from the AKAI MPD26 USB midi pad controller.
 The  16 pads work only if hit hard
 and most of the right hand controls 
 still remain to be implemented,
 so are not functional yet.

 You must set the Akai to preset 5 for Ableton
 Live to get the correct mappings.
  
 No drivers need to be installed in PC.
 Just plug in USB port.
  
 Controls are named same as panel labels.
  
 This version does not capture pad dynamics yet,
 just note on and off.
